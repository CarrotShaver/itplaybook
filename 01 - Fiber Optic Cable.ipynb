    "### Fiber Optic Cables\n",
    "- Single vs. Multi mode fiber\n",
    "    - **Single Mode**\n",
    "        - Cut-off Wavelength: Wavelength above which the fiber will only support a single mode\n",
    "            - Cut-offs which are below the wavelength with support 2+ modes\n",
    "            - Basically, lower cut-off wavelengths will support more modes than higher cut-off wavelengths\n",
    "            - Cut-off wavelength is determined by the *Refractive Index Profile* -- The length and bend of the fiber               \n",
    "        - Mode-field Diameter: Size of optical power distribution in fiber\n",
    "            - Some optical power is distributed outside of the core within the cladding\n",
    "                - For example 30% of the optical power of a fiber may come from the cladding\n",
    "        - Typically used for long distances due to reliability of power, though it is costlier due to the small size\n",
    "        - Yellow jacketed cables are generally single mode\n",
    "        - Standard Diameters:\n",
    "            - Core: 8-10um (micro-meters)\n",
    "            - Cladding: 125um (micro-meters)\n",
    "    - **Multi Mode**\n",
    "        - Numerical Aperture: Measure of range of light accepted by fiber (angles of light)\n",
    "        - Core Diameter: Core design of multi-mode fiber, where a larger core allows for more modes of light\n",
    "            - Multi-mode has much larger core size than single-mode\n",
    "        - Used mainly in LAN's due to the higher loss of light over long distances as light bounces within the larger diameter of the core\n",
    "        - Larger size results in a cheaper cost, but a lower power\n",
    "        - Orange jacketed cables are generally multi mode\n",
    "        - Standard Diameters:\n",
    "            - Core: 62.5um (micro-meters)\n",
    "            - Cladding: 125um (micro-meters)\n",
    "- Diameters and Construction\n",
    "    - Core, Cladding\n",
    "- Performance loss in fiber\n",
    "    - Attenuation: Signal loss along length of fiber (light getting dimmer)\n",
    "    - Dispersion: Distortion of a signal\n",
    "    - Macro/Micro-bending: \n",
    "        - Macro: caused by attenutation over long lengths\n",
    "        - Micro: caused by small bends and wraps made when installing fiber along corners, edges, etc.\n",
    "- How it works: Light refraction off the cladding along the core\n",
    "- Reliability/Durability: does not corrode or rust, is not vulnerable to electrical interference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of Fiber Modes**\n",
    "    - SX and LX Multi-mode: \n",
    "        - Mainly used in LAN environments\n",
    "        - Good up to ~550m\n",
    "    - LX Single-mode: \n",
    "        - Good up to ~5km\n",
    "        - Uses 1270-1335nm wavelength\n",
    "    - LX10 Single-mode: \n",
    "        - Good up to ~10km\n",
    "        - Uses 1360nm wavelength\n",
    "    - EX Single-mode:\n",
    "        - Good up to ~40km\n",
    "        - Uses 1310nm wavelength\n",
    "    - ZX Single-mode:\n",
    "        - Good up to ~70km\n",
    "        - Uses 1550nm wavelength\n",
    "    - BX10 Single-mode:\n",
    "        - Single Strand (Can do upstream and downstream with a single fiber)\n",
    "            - Also known as \"Bi-Di\" (bi-directional)\n",
    "            - Uses a pair of different wavelengths, one for downstream and one for upstream\n",
    "        - 1480-1500nm downstream, 1260-1360 upstream\n",
    "        - Good up to ~10km\n",

    "- **Connector Types**\n",

    "- **Variables which affect Coupling**\n",
    "    - End gap: small gap or space between fiber optic ends\n",
    "    - Mismatch: ends are slightly above/below resulting in a loss of light\n",
    "    - Dirt: Particles which are blocking light on a fiber cable\n",
    "    - Axial Run-out: a bend on one end which may cause a small angle to be left open\n",
